summary: Mario + Portal platformer
description: |
  Two genre defining games from completely different eras: Nintendo's Super Mario Bros. and Valve's Portal. These two games managed to give Platformers and First-Person Puzzle Games a solid place in the video game world. But what if Nintendo teamed up with Valve and recreated the famous Mario game with Portal gun mechanics?

  A complete from scratch recreation of Super Mario Bros. with a focus on perfectly imitating the feel the 1985 classic gave us. Then give Mario a portal gun, add puzzle game mechanics from Portal and there you go. And if that wasn't crazy enough, play 4-player coop, with everyone having their own Portal gun!

  ## Features ##
  -   Complete recreation of SMB
  -   Elements from Portal
  -   Portal gun that shoots portals
  -   4-player simultaneous coop
  -   Level Editor that was used to create the levels in the game
  -   33 different hats
  -   Downloadable Mappacks
  -   Game modifiers for extra fun
